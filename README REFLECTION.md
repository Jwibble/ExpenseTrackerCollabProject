Reflection:
The role that each member had in the project was divided in half with Katrina starting off the project with coding
themenu along the features of addding/viewing/deleting expenses. Eric then added the features of categorizing and 
calculating total expenses. Error handling for each specific feature was done by each person individually. 
Challenges in the proeject included learning and understand how to use git properly along with the differernt styles
of coding that each person writes. 
Additionally there were miscommunications about the different code structues and the inconsistant code. 
These issues could be solved through clearer communication and by being specific, often asking each other 
if the written code would work properly with what was already there.
Overall, our group found that collaborative coding is a good learning
opportunity along with helping build our cooperation/communication skills. 
When it comes to the overall enjoyment, we feel that working by oneself would still be more convenient
as it doesn't present much issues that would come up with collaborative coding such as the miscommunication
and proper task coordination.
