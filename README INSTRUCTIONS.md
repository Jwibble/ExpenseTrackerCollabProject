The Expense Tracker Collab Project with Eric and Katrina
Instructions by Eric


When the Expense Tracker is open, you will be shown and prompted to choose 1 of the 6 possible actions.

ACTION 1
If "Add New Expense" is picked, you will then be asked for a category (name) for the item of purchase.
Then you will be asked for a date, and finally, the price of your expense. The item(s) will then be stored in 
the Tracker's library and in order they were added. If no expenses exist in the dictionary, program
will say "No expenses have been added as of now".
